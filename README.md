Personal Portfolio with React, Vite, and Three.js

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website built using React, Vite, and Three.js! This project was inspired by a tutorial I followed on YouTube to learn how to create an interactive 3D personal portfolio page. The website features a captivating 3D object that you can interact with, creating an engaging and unique user experience.
